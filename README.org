#+title: DESIGN PATTERN

* Design Pattern Introduction
** Four Essential Elements:
- The *pattern name* is a handle we can use to describe problem, its solutions, and consequences in a word or two
- The *problem* describes when to apply the pattern
- The *solution* describes the elements that make up the design, their relationships, concrete design or implementation, because situations.
- The *consequences* are the results and trade offs of applying the pattern.

| Design Pattern          | Definition                                                                                                                                                             |
|-------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Abstract Factory        | Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.                                                  |
| Adapter                 | Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. |
| Bridge                  | Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.                                                                                |
| Builder                 | Separate the construction of a complex o object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.                    |
| Chain of Responsibility | Avoid coupling the sender of the request to its receiver by giving more that one object a chance to handle the request. Chain  the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it. |
